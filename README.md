~~lightweight~~ bungeecord alternative for eaglercraft servers running protocolsupport

now contains an optional **login system**!! :D

Thanks to LAX1DUDE and md-5 for very small snippets of EaglerBungee used in this project (specifically for the server icon, skins, & entity remapping)

**TODO: more bungee backwards compatibility, a few more kick messages/reasons, scoreboard & tab clearing, & automatic java player skins**
